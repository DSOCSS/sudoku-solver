# Sudoku Solver

This program is intended to solve any given sudoku board, if a unique solution exists.

## Code Information

This project is written in [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/). To install TypeScript, first install [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en) to get access to npm. Once Node is installed, install TypeScript globally via ```npm install -g typescript``` or locally via ```npm install --save-dev typescript```. 

> To compile the sudoku TypeScript file, run ```tsc <filename>.ts``` (`<filename>` is to be replaced by any TypeScript filename, such as `sudoku.ts`).

> To run the corresponding JavaScript file, run ```node <filename>.js``` (`<filename>` is to be replaced by any JavaScript filename, such as `sudoku.js`).

This project uses the [Jest](https://jestjs.io/) testing framework for TypeScript. Install TypeScript Jest via ```npm i -D ts-jest @types/jest```. 

> To test the program, run ```npm test```.

Note: After changing code, compile the TypeScript files before running unit tests or running the JavaScript file.
